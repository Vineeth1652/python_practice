# Average score obtained by a student - 68.3
#
# Write a script with if-elif-else blocks to determine the grade obtained by a student based on the total average obtained. Use the following criteria to determine the grade:
#
# if total average >= 90, display "Distinct".
# if in range [60, 90), display "Above average".
# if in range [40, 60), display "Average".
# else display "Fail"
# avg=68.3
# if avg>=90:
#     print("Distinct")
# elif avg>=60 and avg<=90:
#     print("Above average")
# elif avg>=40 and avg<=60:
#     print("Average")
# else:
#     print("Fail")
